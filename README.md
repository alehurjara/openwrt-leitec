OpenWRT for old RT2880 routers
==============================

This is a fork of OpenWRT Attitude Adjustment 12.09.1 that may occasionally
back out of certain upstream changes, but most importantly adds support for
some older Ralink RT2880-based routers previously unsupported by OpenWRT and/or
other alternative firmware.

Fully supported:

- Airlink101 AR725W
- Asante SmartHub AWRT-600N

Supported with limitations:

- Linksys WRT100 (not yet tested)
- Linksys WRT110
- Linksys WRT160N v2

The limitations stem from having only 16MB of RAM. More info is in the wiki.

Any contributions are very much welcome!
