OpenWRT for old RT2880 routers
==============================

This is a fork of OpenWRT Attitude Adjustment 12.09.1 that may occasionally
back out of certain upstream changes, but most importantly adds support for
some older Ralink RT2880-based routers:

- Airlink101 AR725W
- Asante SmartHub AWRT-600N
- Linksys WRT100 (not yet tested)
- Linksys WRT110

Any contributions are very much welcome!
