OpenWRT for old RT2880 routers
==============================

This is a fork of OpenWRT Attitude Adjustment 12.09.1 that may occasionally
back out of certain upstream changes, but most importantly adds support for
some older Ralink RT2880-based routers:

- Airlink101 AR725W
- Asante SmartHub 600 (AWRT-600N)
- Linksys WRT110 (in progress)

Any contributions are very much welcome!
